### 2.2 Summary of the Project (30 points)

In a paragraph or so, mention the main idea behind your project. Focus on the problem setup, not the solution, i.e. what is your goal? At the very least, you should have a sentence that clearly explains the input/output semantics of your project, i.e. what information will it take as input, and what will it produce. Mention any applications, if any, for your project.

### 2.3 AI/ML Algorithms (10 points)

In a single sentence, mention the AI and ML algorithm(s) you anticipate using for your project. It does not have to be a detailed description of the algorithm, even the sub-area of the ﬁeld is sufﬁcient. Examples of this include “planning with dynamic programming”, “reinforcement learning with neural function approximator”, “deep learning for images”, “min-max tree search with pruning”, and so on.

### 2.4 Evaluation Plan (30 points)

As described in class, mention how you will evaluate the success of your project. In a paragraph, focus on the quantitative evaluation: what are the metrics, what are the baselines, how much you expect your approach to improve the metric by, what data will you evaluate on, etc. In another paragraph, describe what qualitative analysis you will show to verify the project works, such as what are the sanity cases for the approach, how will you visualize the internals of the algorithm to verify it works, what’s your moonshot case, i.e. it’ll be awesome and impressive if you get there. Note that these are not promises, we’re not going to hold you to what you say here, but we want to see if you are able to think about evaluation of your project in a critical manner.
