## Long Ago...
There lived two lovers, Steve and Alex. Their romantic tale is passed down through this song below...\
Two lovers, forbidden from one another\
A war divides their people\
And a mountain divides them apart   
Built a path to be together\
...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...\
Secret tunnel!\
Secret tunnel!\
Through the mountain!   
Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!" (Eisen et al.)

Our AI, Steve, has to dig a tunnel to reach his lover, but wants to get to the end as fast as possible using his limited amount of tools.
